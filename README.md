# Tomato

The final website can be viewd at - https://tomato-qrgo.onrender.com/restaurants

Welcome to Tomato! This is your one stop shop for all restaurants in the USA. With just a couple of clicks, you can find restaurants near you and read their reviews to decide what you will have for you next meal. 

Tomato is a completely responsive web app backed by persistent storage, industry-standard authentication, sessions and cookies (and, for some reason, sounds awfully like Zomato)! Here you will be able to review your favourite restuarants, giving them a rating from 1 to 5 for all other users to see. In addition, if you are a restaurant owner, you can add your restaurant on Tomato to hear feedback from your customers or make your restuarant more known.
